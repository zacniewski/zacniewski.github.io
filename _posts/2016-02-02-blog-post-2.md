This is my second post, written during my cooperation with Idego Group - <a href="https://idego-group.com/blog/grab-your-free-book-with-django-and-celery/" target="_blank">(source here)</a><br/>

Abstract:<br/>
Combination of Django and Celery can be very handy in everyday tasks. We can use different tools for distributing our tasks, both for privileged and unprivileged users, what makes that this idea has a versatile usage.Ask Solem – creator of django-celery and one of the main contributors to Celery still plans new interesting features of his tools. For example, in Celery 4.0 one will be able to execute the task according to sunrises, sunsets etc. It shows that the idea of distributing different kinds of tasks could be all-purpose and still worth research.
