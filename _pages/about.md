<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm Python Developer and educator from Poland, who focuses on Internet Technologies, Computer Vision, and Data Science. I'm involved in scientific and commercial projects, related to these areas.</div>
 
<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm mostly concerned with programming in Python and I still have a lot to learn and a lot to do in this field. The world of Python is fascinating and in connection with Computer Vision, Web technologies, Machine Learning, and few others areas has almost unlimited potential. Things related to Python programming are very absorbing, and give a lot of pleasure. That's why I like it :)</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, you can check my IT and scientific profiles to look at my interests and to discover what I'm currently working on. You can contact me through links below my photo.</div><br>

Work, work, work ...

<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, I had a big pleasure to be a Python Developer in <a href="https://profil-software.com/">Profil Software</a> team. It is a Software House located in Gdynia.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my <a href="https://informatyka.amw.gdynia.pl/2/">department</a> I prefer programming and small scientific projects the most, and I also conduct lectures and laboratories on "Computer Vision", "WWW technologies", "Introduction to Data Science" and "Basics of Android programming". I was a supervisor of many engineering (B.Sc) projects. I also worked (and still working) as a developer (Python, WWW) in a few IT companies. </div>
