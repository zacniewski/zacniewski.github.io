Abstract:<br/>
When one writes non-portable code it has strengths and weaknesses. This particular choice is difficult, because the switch to native API at the beginning of the project may be completely impractical to undo at a later stage. With platform-specific code, one can do virtually anything that the platform is capable of. There are no artificial limits; our Python code has unrestricted access to the same underlying API as the native code. On the downside, depending on a single platform is risky because porting the program to a new system becomes harder with every platform-specific feature one can use.</p>
