I'm an educator and Scientific Developer from Poland, who focuses on Internet Technologies, Computer Vision, and Data Science. I'm involved in scientific and commercial projects, related to these areas.  
I'm mostly concerned with programming in Python and I still have a lot to learn and a lot to do in this field. The world of Python is fascinating and in connection with Computer Vision, Web Technologies, Machine Learning, and few others areas has almost unlimited potential. Things related to Python programming are very absorbing, and give a lot of pleasure. That's why I like it :)  
By the way, you can check my IT and scientific profiles to look at my interests and to discover what I'm currently working on. You can contact me through links at the bottom.  

### Work, work, work

Currently, I had a big pleasure to be a Python Developer in [Profil Software](https://profil-software.com/) team. It is a Software House located in Gdynia, where they build awesome products :)
